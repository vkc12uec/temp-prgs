Assuming you have a mac at your disposal,(the apple IDE, Xcode can be installed only on macs..., no windows version), 1 month at rigorous and maybe 2 at normal pace should be enough.

This estimate should be accurate if one is focussed solely on writing code that WORKS ie satisfies the objective of developing the app. That way u can get and use a lot of reusable code available freely . .. . , agar sab concept pehle seekhne ki koshish karoge then it can be a different story altogether....., as has been for me :(

Also, if you have quality guidance in learning the IDE and everything about mobile app dev, then it can be faster. On the flip side, if there is nobody to help out when stuck, it can take very long.

You should at least give yourself a month, I'd say.
